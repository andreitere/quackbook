# QuackBook

QuackBook is an interactive SQL notebook powered by DuckDB WASM, enabling users to run SQL queries, analyze data, and
explore insights directly in the browser without the need for a backend.

### Motivation

Honestly? Because DuckDB changed the way I work with data. Though I'm not a data scientist, my day-to-day work involves a lot of data manipulation, often through pandas in Jupyter
notebooks.

But I’m an SQL enthusiast at heart, and while pandas has its place, SQL just feels like home. This project stems from that preference, along with a healthy dose of curiosity and a
desire to deepen my understanding. Sure, there are other similar tools out there, some even free. But I wanted to build my own as part of my learning journey.

### What can you do with QuackBook?

Pretty much whatever you can imagine combining SQL and markdown!

QuackBook isn’t just for running SQL in the browser—it’s also a learning tool.

For instance, you can find a quick (yet, unpolished) tutorial on left joins here. The interface offers two types of cells: markdown and SQL, so feel free to combine explanations
with code.

To explore available commands, just press `CMD/CTRL + K`.

And if you import or create tables or attach other databases, you can even inspect schemas with `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + E`.
